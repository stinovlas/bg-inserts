# Board game inserts

This repository contains a library for creating boxes, dividers, spacers and other objects that can be used for creating board game inserts.
It also contains some board game inserts built using this library.

I make these inserts for myself and therefore most of them follow these principles (exceptions are noted for each individual insert):

- no lid lift
- fills the whole boxes
  - this means that you can shake the box or store it vertically and everything stays in place
  - it also increases the structural integrity of the box making it more suitable for horizontal storing
- no sleeves
  - some of the inserts may fit sleeved cards, but I didn't test it
- made for language specific edition
  - most of my games are Czech editions, some are in English
  - all inserts clearly indicates the edition and inner dimensions of the box
  - please note that even with the same inner box dimensions, the component size can sometimes differ between between different language editions
