# Root + expansions

- **Inner box dimensions:** \[215mm, 279mm, 68mm\]
- **Lid lift:** None.
- **Sleeves:** Maybe. The width of the card box is sufficient, but you'll probably have to leave out one of the two main decks.

Root is stored in two boxes. One expansion box holds both maps, closed path markers and all faction mats.
The main game box contains everything else.

This insert stores:

- Root base game

- Root: The Marauder Expansion
- Root: The Exiles and Partisans Deck
- Root: The Vagabond Pack
