Through the Desert from Allplay.

This insert holds just the base game, not Bazaar expansion.

Game board goes on the bottom and the oasis box with the palm trees besides it.
The rest of the boxes sits on the top of the game board.
Rules go on top.

You'll need:

- 3x `camel-box-1.stl`
- 2x `camel-box-2.stl`
- 2x `oasis-tokens-box.stl` (for oasis tokens and river tokens)
- 1x `oasis-box.stl`
- 1x `watering-holes-box.stl`
- 1x `leader-box.stl`

There are two variants of the leader box.
If you wish leader box without the leader tokens cutout,
you need to print `leader-box-no-cutout.stl` instead of `leader-box.stl`.
In that case, leader tokens can be stored together with leaders of each color.

A few notes:

- Insert is suitable for both vertical and horizontal storage.
- Oasis tokens boxes can be used during the play (and if you play with the day side, you can leave the river tokens box aside).
- Camel boxes could be used during the gameplay, but I'd advise against it, especially in higher player counts. It's important to see how many camels are left and boxes can obscure the sight for players that sit further from them.
- Palm trees can be stored assembled, but it requires a bit of tinkering with the leaves orientation.
