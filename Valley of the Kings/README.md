# Valley of the Kings

- **Model at Printables:** https://www.printables.com/model/767218-board-game-insert-valley-of-the-kings-ve-stinu-pyr
- **Inner box dimensions:** \[93mm, 133mm, 33mm\]
- **Lid lift:** None.
- **Sleeves:** Probably not. I didn't test it, but the fit is pretty tight even with unsleeved cards.

I recommend to put the rulebook below the cardbox (but you can put it on top as well).
I store starting decks in one compartment, separated by tomb and help cards.
The second and third era cards go to the second compartment.
This allows for a quick game setup.
