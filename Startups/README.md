Startups from Oink games.

This is just one box with cutouts for various components.
Place insert on top of the cards.
You can place rules on the top (recommended), bottom or even between the cards and the insert.

Insert has six shafts for coin stacks.
Each of these shafts has space for exactly ten coins, which is the starting amount.
You can simply give one stack to each player and start.
This allows for a quick game setup.
If you play with full count of seven players, you'll find the remaining ten coins below monopoly tokens.

Point tokens (+2, +1, -1) for 4-round game have their own compartment.
It's easier to take the point tokens out when you put +2 point token on the bottom and on the top of the stack.

Finally, there's a finger cutout that helps with getting the insert out of the box.
